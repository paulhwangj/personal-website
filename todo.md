# TO-DO LIST FOR THIS PROJECT
[Updated: June 7th, 2022]

## General
- Add responsiveness for mobile devices (it's still imperfect)
- Some overflow issues happening  
- Add JS to implement a dynamic web experience
- Embed my resume as a file or for display somehow (may have to use an API?)

## Javascript Ideas
- Have text and images fade in as the user scrolls throughout the site
- Have a toggle button that puts the website in a "dark" or "light" mode [[creative toggles](https://codemyui.com/tag/toggle-switch/)]

## Education Section
- Add a toggle titled "Related Courses" that reveals a drop down that contains a gallery list of all the cs courses I've taken.
- These "gallery items" in the related courses section should have an animation done when hovered over (JS or CSS)
- Have the "University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh" box fill up with yellow and change text to black when hovered over
